*yarr* is a server written in Go with the frontend in Vue.js. The storage is backed by SQLite.

The goal of the project is to provide a desktop application accessible via web browser.
Longer-term plans include a self-hosted solution for individuals.

There are plans to add support for mobile & tablet resolutions.
Support for 3rd-party applications (via Fever API) is being considered.
